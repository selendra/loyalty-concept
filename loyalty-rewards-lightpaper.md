# Loyalty Rewards Exchange - Business Lightpaper

**Cross-Brand Loyalty Point Exchange Platform**  
**Starting in Cambodia**

---

## The Problem

**This is a global problem affecting loyalty programs worldwide.**

**For Customers:**
- Loyalty points scattered across dozens of different businesses
- Most points expire unused (high rates globally and in Cambodia)
- Not enough points at any single business to redeem anything valuable
- Billions in point value lost annually worldwide

**For Businesses:**
- Customers don't use their points, reducing engagement
- Point liabilities pile up on company books
- No way to attract customers from other brands
- Expensive customer acquisition costs

**The platform starts with Cambodia** where millions in point value are lost annually, serving as a proof-of-concept before regional expansion.

## The Solution

The platform creates a network where customers can:
- **Combine** points from different businesses
- **Exchange** points between brands (Brown Coffee points → Zando points)
- **Trade** points with other customers
- **Redeem** at any participating business

**Example:** A customer has 50 points at Brown Coffee and 30 points at Zando—not enough to buy anything at either place. With the platform, they can combine these into 80 Brown points and get a free coffee.

## How It Works

### For Customers

1. Simple integration through API or dashboard
2. The platform handles all the technical complexity
3. Get paid real money for points the platform purchases
4. Attract new customers from other brands

### The Platform
- The platform buys points from businesses at 80-90% of face value
